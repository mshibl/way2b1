<P class="p2 ft2">Way2B1 HAS COMPLETE DISCRETION TO UPDATE AND CHANGE THE SOFTWARE SERVICES AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME AND TO CHANGE THE SCOPE OR FEATURES OF THE SOFTWARE SERVICES FROM TIME TO TIME. Way2B1 MAY MAKE SUCH CHANGES WITHOUT NOTICE. IF YOU CONTINUE TO USE THE SOFTWARE SERVICES AFTER ANY SUCH CHANGES, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE, YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE CONSENTED TO THEM.</P>

For clarification, Documentation means the official user documentation provided by Way2B1 to Client on the use of the Software Services. Any installation guide or end user documentation not prepared or provided by Way2B1; any online community site; unofficial documentation, videos, white papers, or related media; or feedback does not constitute Documentation.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">Way2B1 hereby grants Client a limited, <NOBR>non-exclusive,</NOBR> <NOBR>non-transferable</NOBR> and <NOBR>non-sublicensable</NOBR> license to access and use the Software Services and Documentation during the Term (defined below) provided Client complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</P>
<P class="p6 ft2">If the Software Services and Documentation are provided to Client for evaluation purposes, Way2B1 grants to Client a limited, <NOBR>non-exclusive,</NOBR> <NOBR>non-transferable,</NOBR> <NOBR>non-sublicensable</NOBR> and <NOBR>royalty-free</NOBR> evaluation license to use the Software Services solely for evaluation prior to purchase (“Evaluation License”). The Evaluation License shall terminate on the end date of the <NOBR>pre-determined</NOBR> evaluation period or immediately upon notice from Way2B1, at its sole discretion. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, Software Services provided pursuant to an Evaluation License are proved to Client “AS IS” without indemnification, support, or warranty of any kind, express or implied. Except to the extent such terms conflict with the specific evaluation terms set forth in the Section, all other terms of this Software Services Agreement shall apply to the Software Services under an Evaluation License.</P>
<P class="p7 ft3">2. Client’s Obligations; License Restrictions</P>
<P class="p8 ft4">Client will (i) be responsible for its and its Authorized Users’ compliance with this Agreement; (ii) be solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, integrity, and legality of Client Data (defined below) and means relating to acquisition of the Client Data; (iii) not provide, make available to, or permit other individuals to use or access the Software Services, except under the terms listed herein, and that Client will responsible for any unauthorized activity of the Software Services; (iv) not sell, resell, rent, or lease the Software Services; (v) not modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, create derivative works, or</P>

<P class="p10 ft3">3. Fees & Payment</P>
<P class="p11 ft4">Client’s Obligations; License Restrictions. All orders placed will be considered final. Fees will be due and payable as set forth in the terms of this agreement or otherwise conveyed to you during the order process. Fees for any Renewal Term shall be at Way2B1’s then standard rates, currently in effect, or if applicable, as otherwise set forth on the web site or otherwise conveyed to you by Way2B1. If Client fails to pay in accordance with the payment terms, Way2B1 shall be entitled, at its sole discretion, (i) to suspend provision of the Software Services temporarily until Client fulfills its pending obligations or (ii) to terminate this Agreement for breach. Unless otherwise stated, all payments made under this Agreement shall be in United States dollars. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, fees are <NOBR>non-refundable.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p10 ft3">4. User Licenses</P>
<P class="p12 ft7">Client may, at any time during the Term, increase or decrease the number of user of the service. Users who are requested to have their access revoked will lose access to the site. Way2B1 will make reasonable attempt to remove access to revoked user upon receiving the request through the proper channel. Any delay revoking the access due to time or day, day of the week, failure of the client to communicate request through the proper channel will not constitute a breach of responsibility by Way2B1. The monthly billing will be determined by the number of users licenses on the first calendar day of the month. Users who have their account revoked will incur licensing charges for the month in which their access was revoked.</P>
<P class="p13 ft8">New users added to the system will be billed for the month in which the account was created.</P>
<P class="p10 ft3">5. Taxes</P>
<P class="p14 ft4">The fees are exclusive of taxes, and Client shall pay or reimburse Way2B1 for all taxes arising out of transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

<P class="p20 ft7"><SPAN class="ft11">Effect of Termination. </SPAN>Termination shall not relieve Client of the obligation to pay any fees or other amounts accrued or payable to Way2B1 through the end of the <NOBR>then-current</NOBR> Term.
